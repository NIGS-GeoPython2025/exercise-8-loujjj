# Exercise 8: Coding and visualizing geostatistics (17 points)

## Motivation

This week's exercise is built around two things we all face at some point in our careers as geoscientists: Statistics and clueless family members. For the first item, we'll focus on converting a few common statistical equations to Python code and using them to analyze some data. For item two, imagine the following scene:

> It's near the end of the year and Christmas break is here. While sitting at a family get-together, you're enjoying thoughts of being away from the university for a few weeks. Suddenly, a clueless family member addresses you:
>
> **Tito Jun**: So, I hear you've been away learning all about rocks at the university. You know, I've always been fascinated by volcanoes.
> 
> **You**: *\<sigh\>* Yes, Tito Ismo... Volcanoes are very interesting. (You hope that is enough to get him to leave you alone).
> 
> **Tito Jun**: Hey, since you know so much about rocks now, why don't you tell me a few things about volcanoes. Might be fun to use some of that big brain of yours. Let's start with something easy...how tall is the average volcano?
> 
> **You**: (How humiliating...you don't know). Well, probably a few kilometers above sea level or something. Are you excited the Lantern Parade later? Should be lots of fun. (You hope changing the subject will steer your tito away from poking fun at you for not knowing something geological. Unfortunately, he is not interested in food, and notices you trying to change the subject).
> 
> **Tito Jun**: Who cares about some silly lights, it seems like you don't know what you're talking about. Why bother spending all that time studying if you aren't learning anything? (Tito Jun seems unaware that volcano elevations are not really the focal point of geology studies. Nonetheless, this is an embarrassing situation, and one it would be nice to avoid).
> 
> **You**: ...

In order to avoid such situations, we'll apply our Python skills to analyze Holocene volcano data from the [Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program](https://volcano.si.edu/). In our analysis, we'll learn how to use our Python equations to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of subsets of volcanoes. Afterward, awkward situations with Uncle Ismo (at least those related to geology) will be easy to solve with a few lines of Python code.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 8 is due on March 29, 2025**.
- **Remember to save  your changes locally, and upload to GitHub after each major change**!

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 8](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L8/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L8/exercise-8.html#general-hints-for-exercise-8) if you're having trouble
- Take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** if you are uncertain about **the style of your code**

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 8 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 8 repository (e.g., `exercise-8-jddianala`) in the instance using Git.
